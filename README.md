The data used for this notebook comes from codebook created during the publication of *Mapping the landscape of COVID-19 Crisis Visualizations* and is available under the following [link](https://osf.io/gf8zr/).

## Purpose
The purpose of this notebook was to generate an overview which visualization type was used for what intended message (e.g Informing about severity etc.). This allows a ranking of the most used visualization types per message.
